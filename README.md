## Installation
To run this project, I used Python 3 and installed the following libraries: numpy, pandas, pyspark, spark, seaborn and matplotlilb.

## Motivation
The goals for this project are the following:
- Develop skills and familiarity with the Spark and MLlib APIs
- Integrate all the skills developed throughout the Nanodegree program, specially data engineering, model tuning and more refined development

## File Descriptions
The Sparkify Jupyter notebook file shows the all the data preprocessing and the model tuning. Only a small fraction of the 12GB dataset was used to run this model.

## Result
The details of the project can be found in my Medium(#https://medium.com/@ccalix.woc/predicting-user-churn-with-pyspark-f6ed15762e6c) article.

## Licensing, Authors and Acknowledgment
The data and guidelines in the notebook belong to Udacity.
